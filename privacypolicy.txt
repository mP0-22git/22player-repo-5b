Privacy Policy

Last updated: January 29, 2026

Music Player - MP3 & Audio ("the App") is developed by Elysium Group. This privacy policy explains how information is collected, used, and disclosed when you use our App.

The App is open source and the source code can be viewed on our GitHub page.

Information We Collect

We do not directly collect, store, or process any personal information from users. The App operates primarily on your device, and your music library, playlists, and preferences are stored locally on your device.

However, the App uses third-party services that may collect information. These services operate under their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to review.

Third-Party Services

The App uses the following third-party services:

Google Play Services
Used for core app functionality and distribution through the Google Play Store.
Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy

Google AdMob
The App displays banner advertisements provided by Google AdMob. AdMob may collect and use data to serve ads, including personalized ads based on your interests. This data may include:
- Device advertising identifier
- IP address (used to estimate general location)
- Device information (model, operating system version)
- App interaction data

You can opt out of personalized advertising by adjusting your device settings:
- On Android: Settings > Google > Ads > Opt out of Ads Personalization

For more information, see Google's advertising privacy policy: https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads

Superwall
The App uses Superwall to display and manage subscription offerings. Superwall collects data to facilitate paywall presentation and to analyze the effectiveness of different subscription screens. This may include device identifiers and information about how you interact with subscription screens. Superwall does not have access to your payment information.
Privacy Policy: https://superwall.com/privacy

Google Play Billing
Subscriptions and purchases are processed through Google Play. We do not have access to your payment details such as credit card numbers. Google handles all payment processing and billing. Your purchase history with our App may be visible to us through the Google Play Console for the purpose of providing customer support and honoring your subscription status.
Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy

Last.fm
The App uses the Last.fm API to retrieve artist biographies and album information, including artwork. When you view artist or album details, the App sends the artist and album names to Last.fm's servers to fetch this content. No personal or device information is sent — only the music metadata needed to look up the relevant artist or album. This data is used solely to display supplementary information within the App.
Privacy Policy: https://www.last.fm/legal/privacy

Advertising

The free version of the App displays banner advertisements served by Google AdMob. If you purchase a subscription or have previously purchased the Pro version, advertisements are not displayed.

Ads shown may be personalized based on your interests, or you may see non-personalized ads depending on your device settings and regional regulations.

Children's Privacy

The App is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal information through one of our third-party service providers, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.

Data Security

While we do not collect personal data ourselves, we are committed to ensuring that any third-party services we use employ commercially reasonable security measures. However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is completely secure.

Links to Other Sites

The App may contain links to external websites or services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these external sites and encourage you to review their privacy policies.

Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.

Your Consent

By using the App, you consent to this Privacy Policy and agree to its terms.
